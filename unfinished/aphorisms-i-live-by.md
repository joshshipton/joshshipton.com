3. the only way you're going to get good at something is by doing it consistently over a long period of time, the easiest way to do this is to enjoy the thing youre doing, the best way to force yourself to enjoy the thing you're doing it to do it with other people or surround yourself with people who love to do the thing. reading about adjacent topics helps too. 
4. having a growth mindset is the number one thing you can do to get ahead. Even if you don't beleive it gass light yourself into beliving it, you can't change your capacity or ability but you can be optomisitc about your potential and somehow that raises your ability.
