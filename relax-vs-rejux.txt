Relaxing Vs Rejuvenating activities 
21/10/2023

(DRAFT)

There’s this big mix up that people have between doing things that are relaxing and doing things that are rejuvenating. I’m quickly gonna define both for you and explain when you should opt for one over the other and why.

Let the domain of discourse here be all activities 

Relaxing - things that are fun, things that relax you and get you ready to do nothing.

Rejuvenating - things that give you energy, things that make you want to work

E.G an ice bath or cold shower isn’t relaxing, but it's rejuvenating after doing it you’ll be ready to do more work afterwards. Light aerobic exercise is rejuvenating but not relaxing. Watching a movie is relaxing but not rejuvenating, you won’t want to do more work afterwards even though it's a restful activity. 

Insight that I want to expand on. Restful is usually more enjoyable as it gives you more dopamine than the work activity, not always the case with rejuvenating though.
