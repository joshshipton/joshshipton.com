business idea

Dating apps have their pro's and con's

some obvious pro's are

- access to people you would otherwise have never had access to
- are there more?

some obvious cons

- lack of accountability from people you match with, can match with 20+ people and never see anyone, leads to a worse experience for everyone
- [skill based matchmaking](https://www.vox.com/2019/2/7/18210998/tinder-algorithm-swiping-tips-dating-app-science) is based almost exclusively on looks. Especially for the women liking men dynamic this seems too shallow


#### Idea

Dating as a service (DAAS)

Dating profile is similar to other sites, upload images, fill out some sort of a questionnaire then wait.

You get a singular match, if both people accept their match they then select their availability, a date is booked and planned at that set availability.

After the date you can select if it went well or not to get the other persons contact details.
