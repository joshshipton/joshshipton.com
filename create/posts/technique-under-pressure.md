something I've been thinking a lot with regards to training grappling sports is an idea that was drilled into my head while I was swimming at an elite level during high school and that's the idea of <u>maintaining technique under pressure</u>.

i did some research into this idea long after i retired from swimming, and <a href="https://memberdesq.sportstg.com/assets/console/customitem/attachments/thetufprincipletechniqueunderfatigue.pdf">this random pdf</a> summarises everything that was preached and drilled unto us really nicely. it makes me think that this was something popular at coaching conferences in Australia, since so many coaches have drilled this into me. Australia is very good at swimming and it makes me think that if this was popular here, its probably a good concept for sport. 

the essence is this, good technique is important, in swimming technique can be thought of as the coefficient that is multiplied by effort to produce speed. Better technique means being able to swim faster with less effort. But the catch is that holding good technique takes a lot of effort, both mental and physical. And when you're racing, especially as the distances get longer, you're going to spend most of the race tired so holding that good technique becomes really hard.

> "in swimming -> (technique * effort) = Speed"

i argue that the same is true for grappling, but the instead of speed, you're looking at probability of being successful as the output of the function.

> "in grappling  -> (technique * effort) = P(technique working)"

and once again just like swimming you're looking athletes being under a considerable amount of fatigue for a large percentage of their time on the competition mats, therefore I argue that practicing technique under fatigue is just as important in grappling as it is in swimming.

But the problem is I NEVER SEE ANYONE BUT WRESTLERS OR JUDOAKS TRAINING THIS. BJJ-ers like usual are far behind on the times, its common to see wrestlers/judokas doing hard drills where they push themselves to exhaustion and then rep out a bunch of double-legs/hiptosses while still under a huge amount of fatigue. This builds the mental toughness and technical autonomy you *NEED* to be able to execute a technique perfectly in live competition when you're too tired to consciously think about what angle your left elbow should be when you start step 3 of your favorite takedown. 

you're tired? it doesn't matter. you've been tired before. ***SHOOTS HUGE DOUBLE LEG AT SUPERHUMAN SPEED TO CLUTCH THE CHAMPIONSHIP WHILST GASPING FOR AIR***.

I think this applies to everything in grappling not just stand-up skills, escaping pins+submissions, passing the guard, retaining the guard, etc. etc. I think having a concious effort of trying to maintain the best technique you can while tired is a great start, and I've seen leaps and bounds in my grappling by incorporating this, never letting myself get sloppy and always striving for excellent technique whenever I do a move in sparring or drilling.

just my 2 cents,
