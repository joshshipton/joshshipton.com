----------
The only way to get better is to do hard things, so you might as well learn to enjoy doing hard things. 

Hard things make you stronger and increase your tolerance for what "hard" is. So although things don't get easier. You get tougher. 

Look at every opportunity to do hard things as an oppurtunity to get stronger through suffering. If you're suffering you shouldn't cower but instead embrace suffering with open arms. 

You are becoming stronger.
