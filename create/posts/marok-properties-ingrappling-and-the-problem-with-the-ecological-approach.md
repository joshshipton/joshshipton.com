----------

Training "Ecologically" is all the rage right now in the BJJ world, personally I have a lot of gripes with the training style, apart from the fact that the aesthetic of the movement sucks, and they use unnecessarily complex words like "invariants" to try to differentiate and John Danaherise their way to legitimacy I think the whole movement has a ton of flaws. I'm going to get into some of these now, the major one being the assumption that grappling follows the *Markov Principle*. 

(footnote I have no qualifications or credentials to make my opinion mean anything, this is all just my opinion and nothing more) 

### What is "Ecological Training" 

Ecological dynamics is an approach to motor learning that emphasizes the interaction between an individual and their environment. It suggests that skills emerge from this interaction, rather than being solely internal to the learner. This approach has shown promise in various sports and physical activities, especially those with more predictable environments and less variation. 

### What tf is a Markov 

Markov models, which underpin much of ecological dynamics theory, operate on the principle that the future state of a system depends only on its current state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it. This is known as the Markov property.

In grappling, this assumption falls short. The sequence of previous moves, the overall context of the match, and the long-term strategies employed by both competitors are crucial. A technique's success often hinges on groundwork laid several moves earlier, violating the Markov property.
