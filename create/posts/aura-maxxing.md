---NOTES---

high aura, high aura people are people with agency that other people gravitate towards.

aura is different from status, you can be high aura and low status but you cant be low status and low aura forever, if you have high aura it means that you have the CAPACITY for high status, given a long enough time frame it is impossible that you dont succeed.

AGENCY COMES FROM DOING THE THING (see volume)

"When you're agencymaxxing, others become more interested in helping you because you're a good investment. You, the agencymaxxer, apply a multiplier to others' help so that their help goes further than if they applied that help to someone who wastes it by not helping themself. People like when their help makes a meaningful difference and they don't like when their help goes to waste." (see luck)

social skills maxxing

    high aura people know how to talk to other people

iterating

you need to be iterating to MAXX your aura, if you arent iterating you're not going to improve, seek real feedback from friends family whatever, youre cooking without tasting. make sure youre only asking for feedback from people you respect.

In my way of thinking, radical agency is about finding real edges: things you are willing to do that others aren’t, often because they’re annoying or unpleasant. These don’t always surface in awareness to the point one is actually choosing -- often they live in a cloud of aversion that strategically obscures the tradeoff.

agency is a neccessary condition for aura but its not sufficient

agency, good communication skills,

confidence, charisma, warmth, tranquility, optimism. Someone recently asked me how one might go about learning charisma, and the answer was really boring: by reading a few books, watching many hours of charismatic people interacting with others, and adopting a few of their habits


enjoy being low status, you can be low status and high aura

moat of statys

-> the longer you can do something without getting results the greater the payoff will be

https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/the-moat-of-low-status-68a

dont worry about status, worry about aura, aura is ephemeral and perumates through everything, status is tied to one signular domain and doesnt matter in the grand scheme of things, if you just maxximize for status you're going to get stuck, if you imagine there being a moat around everything and this moat is the moat of low status, if you never cross this moat you are never going to grow, you have to enjoy being in the moat

To get status, you have to give up status. You have to sacrifice some existing status to make it back and more. This is especially true in creative fields and high-upside opportunities. Writers, musicians, actors, directors, entrepreneurs must all do their time in status limbo. And you don’t know how long that time will be. How well you tolerate this state can be the “winning” difference between you and someone just as talented and hard-working as you.
