four different kinds of luck

1. blind luck

-> something literally falls out of the sky into your lap. being born privliged and healhty is  blind luck

2. persistent tinkering luck

-> ausin says "a certain level of action "stuirs up the pot" bring in random ideas that will collide and stick together in fresh combinations. lets chance operate"/

you get luck from doing things

if you write lots of tweets, some will do better than others. if you take 10,000 shots on goal, one is bound to go in.

<i>tinkering itself fundamentally introduces variability</i> someone with "B" level ability on average will occasionally priduce A+ work by sheer chance.

3. prepared mind luck

this is when you introduce discerment into the qeuation.

austin's words -> "special receptitivty, discerment, and aintutitive grasp of siginifance unique to one particular recipient". Lousi Pastuer characteriszed it for all time when he said 'chace favors the prepared mind"

classic example -> penecillin, he got lucky, but he was smart enough to know what had happened.

difference between persistent tinkering luck and prepared mind luck, you recognized when youve stumbled onto something great, when nobody else might have yet.

4. perfect storm luck.


"The amount of serendipity that will occur in your life is directly proportional to the degree to which you do something you're passionate about combined with the total number of people to whom this is effectively communicated" - Jason Roberts


the perfect amount of doing and telling optimizes luck

"The amount of serendipity that will occur in your life is directly proportional to the degree to which you do something you're passionate about combined with the total number of people to whom this is effectively communicated."

"L = D * T, where L is luck, D is doing and T is telling "

questions for yourself to optimize for luck surface area

? how energetic are you ?

how many shots are you taking on goal? how inclined towards motion are you?

you need to be optimizing for shots on goal. if you're shit at shooting but you shoot enough shots, eventually youre going to get one in.

? how curious are you ?

how determiend are you to learn about your chosen field, other fields and the world around you?

curiosity > intellignce.

easier if you already know the answer to the problem because you have seen a similar one before than trying to brute force the solution with facts and logic

How uniquely are we developing a personal point of view—a personal approach—a personal set of “eccentric hobbies, personal lifestyles, and motor behaviors” that will uniquely prepare us to create? This, in a nutshell, is why I believe that most creative people are better off with more life experience and journeys afield into seemingly unrelated areas, as opposed to more formal domain-specific education—at least if they want to create.

if you're unique people are more attractive to you, all the most intresting people i have ever met "in the wild" were attacted to me because i was decent at grappling and decent at computer science, at either of those standalone im not very intresting but if you combine both it becomes easy to be top 0.01%, most of these people were intresting programmers or engineers or fouders that had an intrest in grappling, they saw i was good and then once we were talking they realsied i could hold my own in the "tech talk". i think this is usually unexpected and the suprise gets people intrigued and lets me talk to them for longer, giving me time to show value and create a connection/ relationship.

if you were catching fish, and you wanted to maximize the amount of fish that you caught there are three main things that you would do

1. incerase the size of your net
2. position yourself better, sail to an area with more fish
3. persist and stay out for longer periods of time

improve your position

Act with agency

" High Agency is a sense that the story given to you by other people about what you can/cannot do is just that – a story. And that you have control over the story. High Agency person looks to bend reality to their will. They either find a way, or they make a way. "  - george mack

most of luck will come from other people giving you oppurtunity, high agency people like to hang out with other high agency people see [link to volume post] about the importance of volume.

ask for things is a good way to get luck, the ev on asking for things is really high

the ev on being nice to people, you should really be nice to people because its the right thing to do and you arent a piece of shit.

but in case you needed extra motivsation the ev (expected value) on being nice to people is absurdly high

if youre only asking for things that you know you can get then youre not aiming high enough, you should practice asking for things that feel unreasonable

learn to love the moat of low status

luck razor george mack, apply to everything
