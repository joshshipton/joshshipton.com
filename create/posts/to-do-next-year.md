should i just stay in perth next year 




do honours, try and do it under max or gozz, see if i can work at cba whilst i do it here? how can i ask them to move back to perth and take my offer here, means i can still train judo here, but am i gonna be bored asf then? idk what to do, aslo means i can save another year, idk idk idk

benefits: 

honours means i can go for grad roles again, plus i can go for reasearch, also means that im missing out on jiujisu oppurtunies and have to work at home. 

living at home is easier 

etc. etc.
