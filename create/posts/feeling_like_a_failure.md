I have a philosophy degree, it's mostly useless *(shoutout 18 year old me's decision making)*. 

But I did pick up some banger quotes and develop taste for good philosophy, let's abuse that to make a "dealing with hopelessness" super doc (^.^)//

<br/>

## nietzsche on goal setting 

> the formula of my happiness: a Yes, a No, a straight line, a goal.
> he who has a why can bear any how

### maybe suffering is good? 

> To those human beings who are of any concern to me I wish suffering, desolation, sickness, ill-treatment, indignities—I wish that they should not remain unfamiliar with profound self-contempt, the torture of self-mistrust, the wretchedness of the vanquished: I have no pity for them, because I wish them the only thing that can prove today whether one is worth anything or not—that one endures.

> Out of life's school of war: What does not destroy me, makes me stronger

### worrying is useless? 

>I spent so much of my life terrified of what I was going to become and whether I was going to be right here right now. God, how much time did I waste afraid I wasn’t going to be right here right now? If I could change, the only thing I’d change about my whole life would be fearing less that I wouldn’t get right here - the place I was going anyway. I wouldn’t change all the mistakes and mishaps, I needed those. But all the constantly worry that I wasn’t going to make it, that took me out of enjoying the moment. It took me out of enjoying these experiences, smiling or eating my lunch or doing whatever I was doing. Know your mission, have faith you’re going to get there. Wherever you go, it’s going to be alright. Just find ways to get out of your head.


### infinite vs Finite games

> [are you playing the game the right way?](https://fs.blog/finite-and-infinite-games/)

### the Serenity Prayer

> God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.
