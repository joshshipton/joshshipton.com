Executive scaffolding is a term i made up that essentially means scaffolding for your executive functions. 

your executive functions can be thought of as what you really want to do, i want to be a good engineer i need to practice, i want to be intresting i should read, i want to be a good athlete i need to train and study tape. 

the problem is we all have days where we dont always want to do exactly what we know we should be doing. 

this can be thought of as a disconnect between your current self and future self, you don't see the direct benefit so you're ok with slacking off "just this once". 

executvie scaffolding then are strucrures or ideas or practices that you erect to make it more difficult for you to stray from your ideal executive functions. 

easy to see and understand examples of this are things like going to university to force you to learn for at least x years. getting a personal trainer or coach to tell you what to do in the gym.
