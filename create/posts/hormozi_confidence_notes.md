Today I was watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt50QF6al8g&ab_channel=AlexHormozi) from Alex Hormozi, Alex is a bit of a "business guru" on YouTube but personally I see him as a bit of a philosopher and see his advice as beneficial to general life instead of to the specific endeavour of Business. I thought the video had some great ideas. Since I don't want to forget these good ideas I started taking notes on some of the ones that stuck out to me the most. Here are those notes.

### Don't build confidence without evidence

Confidence without evidence is an illusion, you're tricking yourself into being confident even though you don't have the backing to support your beliefs, this is pretty much lying to yourself. Confidence without evidence is an illusion, you should do things so you become confident, <u>You shouldn't wait until you're confident to do things</u>. Fake it till you make it should become "walk it before you talk it" prove it to yourself so you don't have to prove it to other, let your path do your talking for you. 

### Solve for proof

The message is 10% of how people percieve what you say. Context is EVERYTHING ELSE. Example of Elon being able to tweet whatever he wants and it going crazy . Because the context of Elon and everything he has achieved allows him to do this. Solve for evidence over everything else. If a billionare is giving bussiness advice someone can't say "you dont know anything about bussiness" because objectively they do. Even if what theyre saying is wrong people or someone else is saying the same thing without the accumen but communicating it better will listen to them just because of what they've done.

### Measuring

Dont measure by results, meaure by effort. if someone is doing better than you compare yourself their input (what theyre doing to get that result) and not their output. The output is irrelevant because its the input that really matters. If you put in the same amount of input or more than someone else you will catch them or overtake them over a long enough time period

### Lagging metrics vs lagging metrics

lagging metrics = what happenbs (outputs)
leading metrics = the inputs that create the outputs

don't track your weight track your calories etc. etc.

### the delta between

focus on the delta between how hard you try and how hard you can possilbly try the lower the gap between these two is all that matters. You should redefine your concept of winning by how small the difference between these two deltas is. because at the end of teh day thats all you can cointrol. Its also more immediate, you see results straight away, this makes it far more motivating to stick with.

### By default if you dont give up, you win

the bets games are ones were there isnt an end. it's to keep playing. bussiness, marridge, being healthy etc. etc. so by defenition 
if you stay in the game. Kobe example " do you think youre someone who is afraid of winning or someone who loves losing" he replied 
"I just love playing to the best of my ability". There aren't two frames "winning" or "loising" this is a false dichotomy, as long as you're playing youre winning by defeault. If you change your defenition of winning to be reliant on your character, and judge your days based on this, as long as you contributed to the character of the person that you wish to become, then you won the day.       

if you have the menu item of things you can do in life, just remove quitting as one of them and then try your next thing.


The rocky cut scene in the move lasts 2 minutes in real life it lasts a lot longer

this is where most people stop, and this is why they don't win


if you play to win you'll be out first. play to outlast and you'll win.

### Other peoples opions

the best thing you can do for your own life is not to listen to other people's opinions about your life. Most people don't want the 
best version of you. They want the version of you who best suits them.

more people root for you when you have succedded than people who rooted for you along the wayA

whenever someone gives you an opinion of what you should do with your life its really what they want to do with their life. People make statements to releasae their discomfortt e.g "you should train less" "your standards are too high" etc etc. and thats their problem not yours so dont worry about it.


### I am statments

people like saying they are things and then love giving a "because" reasaon...


the because benefits nothing, and most of the time you don't even know why you are that way and youre just guessing. All you know is that you do a certain type of behvaiour. My giving these because statemetns power you put things in the past. if you change the mentaltiy to "I do x". then you just change your day to day behviour and give the control to your present self.


### epic stories razor

when choosing between two or more options choose whatever will create the cooler story. Reframe "these are all the reasons that i can't suceed" to. "these are all the reasons why when i suceed it will be awesome.


### Heros vs villans


heros and villans in stories always have the same backstory - pain. The difference is what they choose to do aboutit. The villian says " the world hurt me, i'll hurt it back". The heros says "the world hurt me, I'm not gonna let it hurt anyone else" Heros use pain. Villans are used by pain.

everyone inevitablly feels pain. you just have to choose how you deal with it.


### document your life

document your life when it sucks, not when its great. beacause these are the moments that you can use in the future to prove that you can use to prove who
