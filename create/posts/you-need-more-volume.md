---NOTES---

notes can go here

i'm well aware that the first 100 articles or posts i write will be terrible, i plan to write so much this year that in order to find these posts you will have to trawl through so many articles that the onous of who is weird is taken from me to you. you really read 50 articles to find that one bad one? you're that much of a fan? thats weirder from you than of me


---END NOTES---

this is my north star for 2025, you need to do more, and you need to not care about what the quality is like. the only way to get better is to do.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">if you say you&#39;re ambitious, but you don&#39;t have a body of work you can point at, you should STFU and build the body of work first. even if it&#39;s a bunch of notes and drafts and crappy prototypes or whatever. code your apps, write your plays and poems. I will die on this hill.</p>&mdash; Visakan Veerasamy (<a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1451147667732525063?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@visakanv</a>)</blockquote>

another big reason that you need volume if you're smart and know how to iterate it's virtually impossible to fail at anything if you take enough shots. if everytime you shoot and miss you adjust, you could be the worst shooter in the world and still score at least once.

you need to be trying more, doing more, building up a body of work so that people know you're serious
