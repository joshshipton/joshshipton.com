Wanted to write about a framework that I've been using in my own life, but mostly in my athletic endeavours. Either doing this works wonders and I look like a genius or it blows up in my face. Either way I have a record of my thoughts at this stage in my life and I either look like a genius or learn.

### Explaning the Theory 

I'll explain the theory first and then talk about how it specifically relates to my life.

>**" When you're given options on where to invest your time you should invest it in the same place as the most intense, high achiveing (foot-note1) people"**

my thinking here is that by being around these people you're going to learn how these people act, how they carry themselves, the intensity they bring to the things they do. It's also going to be competive, and there's nothing that drives progess and innovation more than competition.  Contrast this to doing the easiest thing or thing that you're best at. You're not going to learn as much from others, if you're the best you're going to be expected to be the one doing most of the teaching, which is still a good skill but not the same.  

I like to think about that one mushasi quote here 

> To know ten thousand things, know one thing well - Miyamoto Mushashi

By being around high achieving people you're going to learn skills that will transfer to anything. To really get to know these people you're going to have to do their thing, probably even get good at their thing. But thats cool.

### How I'm using this in my own life


embeded the image of the person going "so we're all wrong?" , yes.



foot-note1 - I know I used agency in the title. In my head agency and achivement go almost hand in hand achivement just usally lags behind. It's also not a two way relation, agency always leads to achivement. But just because you have achivement doesn't mean you have agency. 


### Outline 

- Explain theory 
    - opt for agency over specificity

    - explain theory, in regards to grappling sports, training ajacent sports simply because my town is far better in one than the other. by being around these people I learn their intensity and take this back to my own sport. In my case i'm lucky that the sports are somewhat ajacent but i think this relates to other things as well, could see this being really relevant for academics. If you get into a university and don't know what to study, study whatever the university is best at.
