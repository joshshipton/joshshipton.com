here is the josh shipton reading list, some of my favorite books with a quick anecdote about why and what i liked about them this will change and upadte over time and i am sure i am missing things 

expect this to change and update over time as i read more and remember things i have read in the past that should defiently be on this list

if a book is on this list it means that i've read it cover to cover and enjoyed it, if its in green i thought it was well above average and if its in blue i thought it was exceptional
