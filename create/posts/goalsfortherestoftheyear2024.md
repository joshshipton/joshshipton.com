### How I set goals 

My goals for the rest of the year, when I like to set goals I prefer to set goals for systems not results, if I set a goal like "I want to get an A in x unit" this is a bad goal, since there are things about this goal I can't control. I could study super hard, do everything perfectly, all for my professor to crack the shits and fail the entire class with an impossible exam. 

Instead I would set a goal like, 

1. Study 2 hours a night 
2. Go to office hours
3. Do all homework on time 

etc. etc. 

These goals set up a system that if I follow I am extremely likely to get an A in x unit. 


### Goal 1 Destroy opponent in grappling super fight

I've got another grappling super fight booked for the 28th of September. I don't rate my opponent at all so I really want to make a statement and walk through him. In order to achieve this here's my system 

1. Cultivate a weekly training schedule with good training partners that works around my university and other commitments. (done) 
2. Stick to the training plan for the next ~8 weeks
3. spend 30-60 minutes before every training session watching [submeta](https://submeta.io/) in order to make sure I am improving technically. 
4. Use [Kenku](https://kenku.org) to log all training sessions, use problems I log as study points and don't let the same issue happen twice. e.g didn't finish a daarce choke I'm looking up that defense before my next session and making sure that I know how to deal with it. 
5. Pursue excellence in every part of the training session, warm up with excellence, drill with excellence, roll with focus and excellence. I'm not going to be able to spam mat time this camp so this is especially important. 

### Goal 2 Straight Hd's at Uni

My last semester of undergrad, make sure that I'm finishing with a bang, got some fire units this semester, make sure I'm making the most of them. 

1. Do all homework <u> on time </u> (don't cheat)
2. Go to office hours and labs if I don't understand 
3. Make friends with people in my units (This is so OP, I only started doing this last semester but the ROI is insane) 

It's not a lot but to be honest I think doing this will be more than enough to get straight HD's ^_^

### Goal 3 Figure out what I want to do with my life 

idk man, this is a WIP, for now I think the best thing I can do is 

1. Cultivate curiosity, keep learning cool shit and doing cool stuff for the sake of doing cool stuff.  
2. Apply for as many grad roles as possible (get goated at interviewing) 
3. Research and apply for postgraduate study
4. Take whatever option is the coolest
