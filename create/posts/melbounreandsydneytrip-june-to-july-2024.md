### Worked hours spent 

I currently make around $38 an hour at my highest paying job which is working as an orderly with casual rates. 

<div class="center">

$2500/38 = 66 hours of work

</div> 

An average shift at the hospital is around 9 hours, that means I would have to work around 7.5 shifts to afford this trip.
