ontology of grappling techniques - nature of being 

talking to a wrestler about the problems of teaching bjj guys judo and wrestling, they want the steps, they want the knowledge "unlock" that lets them do the technique effectively 

this doesnt exist, great example my friend pointed out was that everyone knows how to sprawl, and a sprawl is the counter for a double leg, but people still hit double legs all the time. something that wrestlers and judoka understand far better than bjj-ers is that sometimes just being better at the technique counts for a lot more than knowing more about it. 

this got me thinking about the ontology (fancy philosophy word for the "nature of being) of grappling techniques. Bjj-ers prefer breaking techniques down into sequential steps, and then chaining the steps togther to create the "technique" whereas judoka and wrestlers prefer to see the technique as a whole, acknowledging its basic parts that may sometimes be executed in a distinct temporal order. 

This is the main problem with Bjj-ers their ontology breaks down technqiues to their sequential minute steps, and they hope that by doing this they will have a better understanding of the technique as a whole, but judoka and wrestlers understand that you have to acknowledge the technique in it's entirety in order to truly understand it. 

I have no clue what im on here, this is a wild post, come back to this later but I would be suprised if i ever saw it on joshshpton.com
