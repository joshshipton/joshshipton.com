---END NOTES---

at the start of 2025 i spent a lot of time thinking about what lever's i wanted to pull, obviously you want to pull the longest levers, the ones that are going to give you the most return and make the most difference in your life.

at the micro level this looks like domains and skills but on the macro i think this looks like attitudes and actions. after a lot of thinking i've settled on these four domain-agnostic principles that i want to be MAXXING in 2025. follow these links for more of a breakdown by what i mean and what it looks like to max each one of these principles.

i think that these four things are literally all you need to be domain-agnostic successful, each of these documents are evergreen and will be added to overtime.

each trait can be thought of as a cascading into the others,

more volume -> better taste

better taste -> more aura

more aura -> more luck
