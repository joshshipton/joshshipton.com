what im maxxing rn

- volume
- taste
- aura
- luck

i think that these four things are literally all you need to be enviroment-agnostic successfull, each of those four documents are evergreen and will be added to overtime.

each trait can be thought of as a cascadding into the others,

more volume -> better taste

better taste -> more aura

more aura -> more luck
