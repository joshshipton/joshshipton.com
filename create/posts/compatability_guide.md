Here are some things about me computability wise, inspired by Nate Soares' in-depth [communication handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o1JaH2nxbpfHgpx25dwJnQ3dQAPikmlqrn6c9gNP9gE/edit#heading=h.6o6m4x2z3grc) I originally wrote this to understand myself better (and as a result isn't edited), but thought other-people might find it interesting and/or benefit from it. Here it is. 

I’ve noticed i have a low tolerance for negativity, for example i really enjoy being around people who will rise to the occasion of hard tasks rather than sink to complaining 

i really don’t like people who call me stupid. even as a joke. don't do it. 

i really don’t like being asked to justify my decisions to people who don’t have context. I.e If you know nothing about grappling and try to get me to justify why I train so much I tend to get annoyed, I dislike people pushing what they would do into my situation onto me, when what they would do in my situation isn't what I am going to do in my situation (i.e they wouldn't train so much so they feel the desire to tell me that I train too much, where I do not care about their opinion in this domain as they are not someone who has enough context to understand the entirety of the situation.) 

I enjoy spending time with people who are quite eccentric and think in divergent ways, even if I don't agree with them I enjoy how they open my mind and learning about their perspective. 

It is very rare for me to interact with someone on all levels of my personality concurrently, if you know me from grappling and know Josh the athlete, it's rare for me to engage in a professional/academic conversation with you, this is deliberate and if i'm not engaging please do not push or pry. This is more common in the I know someone socially and they pry into my athlete life or I know someone through university/work and they pry into my athlete life. Again this will come down to having to explain too much context and I feel as though by explaining these things to people I give them information/context/right to have an opinion on this side of me. Which since I have only ever introduced one side of my personality to, they have no reason/right to do this nor do I care/I will probably get annoyed at them having an opinion that is very unlikely to be well-formed or beneficial. 

However, I am very receptive to and very much enjoy being given feedback (even unsolicited feedback) from people I trust and am friends with as long as it sticks to the domain in which they are friends with me. I.E If you are friends with the athlete Josh, and you find out I study computer science do not tell me that AI is going to take my job, this is unguided and provides no benefit to anyone. 

If you (rarely) catch me complaining about something, please do not pity me, do not tell me I am doing too much or need to take a step back.  If you wish to be helpful provide constructive feedback as to how i could better approach what I am doing or manage my time. If I am truly doing too much help me understand what can be cut out.

I don't believe in holidays, I get the most pleasure out of working towards my goals, taking time away from working on my goals does not sound relaxing in the slightest but instead fills me with anxiety and dread, please do not try to get me to go on Holiday, I despise holidays. I will however happily travel in order to train/learn from/gain knowledge of something that I am interested in/find useful.
