Here are some questions that I like to have answers to before going into a behavioural interview. 

- how do you solve a challenging situation
- do you usually set goals? 
- tell me about a time you had a conflict? 
- tell me about a time you took initiative?
- tell me about a time you showed leadership?
- tell me about a time you had a tight deadline?
- tell me about a time you had to adapt to a new situation?
- tell me about a time you made a mistake?
- what's your biggest weakness?
- tell me about a time you had to solve a problem without knowing all the information?
- tell me about a time you had to persist through challenges to reach a result
- why do you want to work at {company}?
