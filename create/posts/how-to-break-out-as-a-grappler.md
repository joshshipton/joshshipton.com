short post about how to break out as a grappler

relevant see [link to luck] [oppurtunity increases exponeitally]

the tdlr:

    - be serious
    - be good

done

the longer version

- become the best in your country then the best in your continent before going internatonal for training
    - for me going to melbourne was incredible, the training was maybe 5% worse than going to america, but it was 5x cheaper.
    - travelling to train, sometimes long distances communicates to people that you're serious about this

- go to big comps without belt restircitons (think adcc comps)
    - if you can get a big scalp and do it in a big way people will notice, you can steal

- cross train
    - not just for the training but also to meet more people, in the future these people can vouch for you, that you're serious and good

- be friendly [link to aura maxxing]
    - friends are training partners, people who can share information with you,  people whose couches you can crash on

- post on socials
    - your instagram is your resume, make sure its good, make sure a glance at your isntagram communicates professionalism and seriousness

- be good
    - simple but overlooked, make sure youre actually good, at least for your area, if you're not good you can have the best oppurtunies ever come up to you but you won't have the means to capatilize on them, its like waiting at the bus stop for a bus, then the bus comes and you dont even have a ticket.
