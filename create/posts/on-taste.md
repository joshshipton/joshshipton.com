on a possible defenition for taste

> Good taste is usefully defined as the capacity for deep aesthetic pleasure, and the discernment to judge whether a given thing is capable of inducing deep aesthetic pleasure

is taste just in groups and outgroups?

> But when it comes to these areas, most mentions of taste have little to do with actual aesthetics, and more to do with intent to define in-groups, and denigrate those who don’t belong to them. When Y says that X has bad taste, what they usually mean is that X doesn’t belong to Y’s circle, and wasn’t brought up with the same cultural references and role models. Which is fine, we all tend to think that our manners and sense of style and so on are right; but using a loaded term such as ‘taste’ as short hand for ‘others don’t behave like we do’ is a bit disingenuous.

taste is like grammar
"""

Grammar is a set of rules for speaking a language. Some of these rules are sensible and necessary, but others are arbitrary or even actively anti-rational. For example, it would make more sense to say “he goed” than “he went”, but only the latter is correct.

People feel on a deep level that poor grammar is wrong - misplaced apostrophes can send pedant’s into a rage. But descriptivists helpfully tell us that this is mostly arbitrary, and that some minority groups have alternate grammars which are just as good and consistent as ours, despite sounding atrocious (eg “I ain’t be going”).

Even though in some sense grammar is about agreeing on a set of rules for easy communication, some people are more sophisticated than others and “know” that the majority way of speaking is wrong. My former English teacher spent her life waiting for someone to ask “Is Mrs. So-And-So here?” so that she could answer “I am she!” and follow it with an explanation of why the natural instinct to say “I am her” is “wrong”. This particular rule has a sort of rational explanation - the copula takes the nominative case. But when you get into why the copula takes the nominative case, it’s hard to tell whether this is a natural fact about the definition of cases, or whether Latin-obsessed grammarians unfairly demanded that Anglophones follow the Latin usage. Other examples are more clearly inappropriate Latinizations - for example, you originally couldn’t split an infinitive in English because doing so was impossible in Latin; only later did people develop a “sense” that this “sounded wrong”.

So the sophisticates do have reasons behind what they do - but the reasons are arbitrary and kind of stupid. Still, if you do it the wrong way, they’ll laugh at you. Most people don’t want to be laughed at by sophisticated people, and we summarize this situation as “it’s bad grammar, but only grammarians are sophisticated enough to realize this.”

questions to ask yourself
    - why do you like what you like
    - why dont you like what you dont like

if you dont make things you dont really have ground to stand on

IMPORTANT DISCTICTION


<u> if something is in good taste it should rewards attention with pleasure </u>

old mates examples about more attention giving more pleasure


notes

i think that taste is just knowing what will hit your target audience just right, this is what you need to work on, you need to work on collating things that are beuaitufl and make you feel a certain way.

actual essay:

intro: idk

#### what is taste?

there are tons of different definitions for taste, and you could argue about defenitions forever. however i care less about what the "correct" defenition is and more about what the "useful" defenition is.

i think it makes the most amount of sense to subscribe to some sort of platonistic aetheitcs.

[platos aetheitcs](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-aesthetics/) are based on the idea that beautiful things are imitations of a perfect and unchanging original. plato belived that the physical world is a decaying copy of this original, and that beuaty is an imperfect copy of Beauty itself.

this is useful becuase it serves as an ideal to strive for, we should try and work on and correct our taste so we can get closer and closer to this ideal beauty.

#### why i want to develop good taste in 2025

i believe that

taste is important because you need to make sure you are working on the right things, you want to be working on things that are going to be recived well.

another important reason is that the more and more abundace we create as a species the more and more competitive everything becomes and the more we value taste. put beuautifuly by Anu Atluru

#### but how do i develop good taste?

great question, im trying to figure this out right now, i think its simpler than most people think.

> "Ultimately, it comes down to taste, it comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best things that humans have done and then trying to bring those things into what you're doing. Picasso had a saying: "good artists copy, great artists steal." - Steve Jobs

i think you just have to expose yourself to people with good taste as much as possible

you also need to be producing and not just consuming, you should find something that you don't have to force yourself to do. ask yourself "what do i already like? what am i naturally interested in? then produce in this space constantly asking yourself what's good and what's not good.

over time you will naturally develop a sixth sense for taste

taste is two things

1. consume good content, consume things that people have spent time and energy creating. <u> if something is in good taste it should rewards attention with pleasure </u>. watch a piece of reality tv, then watch any of x. one gets significantly better the more attention you give to it, the other can only be consumed if you don't pay too much attention.

2. you have to be prolific, you have to have a large body of work, created brick by brick. everytime you make something you have to think about what made it good and what made it bad and iterate. you need to be iterating.

#### what im doing to develop good taste

building and writing as much as i can

my philosophy is the more i create the more feedback i am going to get, everytime i write or create anything i can see the finished product as a whole and iterate on it, keeping and extending the parts that i think are good, and fixing up what i think is bad.

if you iterate over and over again you are going to get better everytime, if you do this for long enough you're going to develop what you want.

not being scared of producing crappy stuff, i have tons of unfished articles and essays that im scared to release because i don't believe they are good enough, i think you have to be willing to produce bad work, its far more valuable to just post, iterate, post, iterate, than work on one work over and over again.

to quote Visakan Veerasamy who i think is one of the absolute smartest and under-rated thinkers on the planet

> You have a far greater shot at tasting greatest and fun if you siply wriute as much as you possibly can, and then some. Why? because your concept of 'best' is a work-in-progress and a moving target. Why spend a year working on writing the best song you can, when you could instead spend a year improving your idea of what makes a song great?

the other big thing that you can do to work and adapt taste is to criqitize everythng you see, if you see an outfit or advertisment you like or dont like take 10 seconds to express to yourself why you feel that way. try to point out specific things. by taking the internal feeling and forcing yourself to express it into language you start to conciousely understand why some things are better or worse and why you feel differntly towards certain things.
