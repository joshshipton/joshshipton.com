how to get good taste

> "Ultimately, it comes down to taste, it comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best things that humans have done and then trying to bring those things into what you're doing. Picasso had a saying: "good artists copy, great artists steal."

why taste is more important today

> "In a world of scarcity, we treasure tools. In a world of abundance, we treasure taste"  - (Anu Atluru)[https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/taste-is-eating-silicon-valley]

on a possible defenition for taste

> Good taste is usefully defined as the capacity for deep aesthetic pleasure, and the discernment to judge whether a given thing is capable of inducing deep aesthetic pleasure

is taste just in groups and outgroups?

> But when it comes to these areas, most mentions of taste have little to do with actual aesthetics, and more to do with intent to define in-groups, and denigrate those who don’t belong to them. When Y says that X has bad taste, what they usually mean is that X doesn’t belong to Y’s circle, and wasn’t brought up with the same cultural references and role models. Which is fine, we all tend to think that our manners and sense of style and so on are right; but using a loaded term such as ‘taste’ as short hand for ‘others don’t behave like we do’ is a bit disingenuous.

taste is like grammar
"""

Grammar is a set of rules for speaking a language. Some of these rules are sensible and necessary, but others are arbitrary or even actively anti-rational. For example, it would make more sense to say “he goed” than “he went”, but only the latter is correct.

People feel on a deep level that poor grammar is wrong - misplaced apostrophes can send pedant’s into a rage. But descriptivists helpfully tell us that this is mostly arbitrary, and that some minority groups have alternate grammars which are just as good and consistent as ours, despite sounding atrocious (eg “I ain’t be going”).

Even though in some sense grammar is about agreeing on a set of rules for easy communication, some people are more sophisticated than others and “know” that the majority way of speaking is wrong. My former English teacher spent her life waiting for someone to ask “Is Mrs. So-And-So here?” so that she could answer “I am she!” and follow it with an explanation of why the natural instinct to say “I am her” is “wrong”. This particular rule has a sort of rational explanation - the copula takes the nominative case. But when you get into why the copula takes the nominative case, it’s hard to tell whether this is a natural fact about the definition of cases, or whether Latin-obsessed grammarians unfairly demanded that Anglophones follow the Latin usage. Other examples are more clearly inappropriate Latinizations - for example, you originally couldn’t split an infinitive in English because doing so was impossible in Latin; only later did people develop a “sense” that this “sounded wrong”.

So the sophisticates do have reasons behind what they do - but the reasons are arbitrary and kind of stupid. Still, if you do it the wrong way, they’ll laugh at you. Most people don’t want to be laughed at by sophisticated people, and we summarize this situation as “it’s bad grammar, but only grammarians are sophisticated enough to realize this.”

IMPORTANT DISCTICTION


<u> if something is in good taste it should rewards attention with pleasure </u>

old mates examples about more attention giving more pleasure


notes

i think that taste is just knowing what will hit your target audience just right, this is what you need to work on, you need to work on collating things that are beuaitufl and make you feel a certain way.

intro: idk

#### what is taste?

there are tons of different definitions for taste, and you could argue about defenitions forever. however i care less about what the "correct" defenition is and more about what the "useful" defenition is.

i think it makes the most amount of sense to subscribe to some sort of platonistic aetheitcs.

[platos aetheitcs](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-aesthetics/) are based on the idea that beautiful things are imitations of a perfect and unchanging original. plato belived that the physical world is a decaying copy of this original, and that beuaty is an imperfect copy of Beauty itself.

this is useful becuase it serves as an ideal to strive for, we should try and work on and correct our taste so we can get closer and closer to this ideal beauty.

> Good taste is usefully defined as the capacity for deep aesthetic pleasure, and the discernment to judge whether a given thing is capable of inducing deep aesthetic pleasure
