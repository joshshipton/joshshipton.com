----------
Some quick context before I pivoted to computer science I studied philosophy at university. I planned to finish my bachelors degree then pursue further studies and eventually end up in academia. 

Out of all the [branches of Philosophy]((https://leverageedu.com/blog/branches-of-philosophy/#:~:text=Through%20the%207%20branches%20of,human%20mind%20and%20the%20world.). I found Moral Philosophy to be the most interesting. If you've spent enough time with me in person you have undoubtedly heard me bring up Neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics. The goal of this entry is to have a simple summary of virtue ethics that I can direct people to if my in-person explanation is insufficient. 

### Speedrunning context any % 

In order to understand why N-A virtue ethics is so genius you'll need an understanding of some of the basic moral theories, you've probably heard of them before so I'll make it quick.


###### The Golden Rule

> *"Treat everyone else how you want to be treated"*

**Explanation** 

Self explanatory 

**Obvious Problem**

Imagine we have a person called Jeff, Jeff has a disorder in which he derives pleasure from people being mean to him, it doesn't feel right that this justify Jeff being mean to everyone else. 

&#8756; !(The Golden Rule)

###### Deontology

> *"Treat every action like it would become a universal rule"*  

**Explanation** 

Every time you do something ask yourself "if everyone else was forced to do this forever would this be a good or a bad thing?" If it would be good, keep doing it. If not, don't. Classic examples are; It would probably be better if everyone didn't always lie, so don't lie. Or the world would probably be better if everyone didn't kill someone else over a minor disagreement, so don't kill people. Deontology and the author behind it is notorious for being horrendously complicated but this is good enough for now. 

**Very Obvious Problem** 

Just because it would be wrong to do something in some cases doesn't mean that it's wrong in all cases. There are some very obvious examples where it would be good to lie. 

Imagine an axe murder comes to your house and asks you where your friend is, they tell you that they are going to use this information to find and murder your friend. In this case it's pretty obvious that you should lie to the axe murder. But under deontology this would be "wrong". 

&#8756; !(Deontology)

###### Utilitarianism

(deontology, util, virtue-ethics)

x in this theory 
y in this theory
z in this theory 

show why they're all insufficient quickly, deontology - axe murder, util maximizing pleasure feels wrong sometimes, virtue ethics = circular

explain neo-aritotelian virute ethics, explain how it fixes these problems
