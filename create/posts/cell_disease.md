I was watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU&t=3889s) when the guest started talking about [Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton). Earlier in the year I wasted quite a few hours on [this site](https://playgameoflife.com/) playing around with guns, spaceships and other kinds of automata. 

With more time on my hands I decided I wanted to play around and learn more about cellular automata. I have no idea why I find them so fascinating but I could watch them for hours. During the course of development for this project I lost a lot of time starting and re-running the simulation. There's something about such simple rules being able to create such vivid patterns that creates a psychedelic experience. 

After researching practical applications for cellular autoamta I can upon [this](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjs/s11734-022-00619-1) paper. Where someone used cellular automata to model the spread of COVID. 

This didn't seem as sophisitacted as other ideas that I was interested in like [traffic flow](https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:483914/FULLTEXT01.pdf) (I'm coming for this later) so I decided to tackle it. 


If you want to play around with the disease simulation yourself I'm hosting it [here](), plug in whatever values you want and go crazy. 

If you're interested in the code and how everything works you can find that [here](https://github.com/joshshipton/cellular_automata_disease). Any obvious bugs/huge errors feel free to make a PR or contact me. 

<h4>Next steps</h4> 

I enjoyed/am enjoying this project. But I don't know how far I can push it. I'm going to start reading [*"Designing Beauty: The Art of Cellular Automata"*](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/47988064-designing-beauty-the-art-of-cellular-automata-emergence-complexity-an) by Andrew Adamatzky and see what I learn/what inspiration I get. More Cellular Automata art/simulations are definitely on the cards.
