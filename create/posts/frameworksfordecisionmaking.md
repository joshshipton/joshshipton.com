i recently had to make a tough decision that had two clear options (a binary yes/no decision), it took me a long time to make the decision and caused me a lot of strife and pain. i'm happy with my final decision but want to make sure i've learned from the experiecnce to make my life easier for next time, here are the best decision making frameworks that helped me. 

### thought experiments 

- what would it look like if this hard decision were a good thing? 
- what would i do if money werenâ€™t a factor? 
- if someone else were forced to make this decision for me, which option would hope they choose?
- what would i do if i were my future child? 

### for calculations with money 

- in the future if i made one decision would i pay x amount of dollars to reverse the decision? 
- the cost in hours worked instead of in raw dollar value, would i work x amount of hours to do x 

###  Useful Razors</a> 

- Luck Razor - If stuck with 2 equal options, pick the one that feels like it will produce the most luck later down the line. 
- Bezos Razor - If unsure what action to pick, let your 90-year-old self on death bed choose it.

(both of these are from <a href="https://x.com/george__mack/status/1728696014754676952"> george mack </a> 

- Exellence Razor - Which decision exposes me to more excellent people and/or cultures (see <a href="https://joshshipton.com/post/excellence-is-everything"> EXCELLENCE is everything </a>

### predict the future 

- write stories visualising your future if you pick either decision. how do you feel about each outcome? 
- make a pros and cons list for each side. 

### once the decision has been made 

- use the thought of the sunken cost from the other decision to push you to make the most out of the decision you made. remind yourself of what you sacrificed (the pro's from the opposite decision) and use this as executive scaffolding to push you to make the most out of the oppurtunity.
