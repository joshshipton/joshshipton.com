i recently had to make a tough decision that had two clear options (a binary yes/no decision), it took me a long time to make the decision and caused me a lot of strife and pain. i'm happy with my final decision but want to make sure i've learned from the experiecnce to make my life easier for next time, here are the best decision making frameworks that helped me. 


### thought experiments 


what would i do if i were my future child? 
what would it look like if this hard decision were a good thing? 
what would i do if money werenâ€™t a factor? 
if someone else were forced to make this decision for me, which option would hope they choose?


### for calculations with money 

- the cost in work hours instead of the monetary cost 
- in the future if i made one decision would i pay x amount of dollars to reverse the decision? 

### Out of the two actions 

- which action maximises luck
- which action maximises excellence 

### predict the future 
- write stories visualising your future if you pick either decision. how do you feel about each outcome? 

### once the decision has been made 

- use the thought of the sunken cost from the other decision to push you to make the most out of the decision you made.
