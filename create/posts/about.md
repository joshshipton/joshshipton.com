----------

This site mainly functions as a place to document things I find interesting. If you expected any type of consistency or order, you're in the wrong place. My main interests are programming, how humans learn and my current crown-obsession <u>grappling sports</u>. 

Some common themes for posts are:

- things I'm working on

- ideas or concepts I've come across and want to remember for later

- i've had an experience I want to document and revisit in the future
