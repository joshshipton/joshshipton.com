"Everyone gives what he has. The warrior gives strength, the merchant gives merchandise, the teacher teachings, the farmer rice, the fisher fish."
"Yes indeed. And what is it now what you've got to give? What is it that you've learned, what you're able to do?"
"I can think. I can wait. I can fast."
"That's everything?"
"I believe that's everything!"
"And what's the use of that? For example, the fasting—what is it good for?"
"It is very good, sir. When a person has nothing to eat, fasting is the smartest thing he could do. When, for example, Siddhartha hadn't learned to fast, he would have to accept any kind of service before that day is up, whether it may be with you or wherever, because hunger would force him to do so. But like this, Siddhartha can wait calmly, he knows no impatience, he knows no emergency, for a long time he can allow hunger to besiege him and can laugh about it. This, sir, is what fasting is good for."

 If you're at a much higher level than someone you can always seem
mystical because you're doing things which are outside of their conceptual
scheme. The way that operates in the martial arts is if you think about it through
the lens of frames, if you and I are looking at a position and in your mind,
there's this position, this position, and this position so there are three positions.
In my mind if I'm constantly training at the transitions between these positions,
these actually expand into these transitional frames and become positions to me.
So if I'm seeing 100 positions when you're seeing two, then I can play in your
blind spots and I can seem mystical to you because you haven't trained there.

An hour passes. I’m warmer now, the pace has got my blood going. The years have taught me one skill: how to be miserable. I know how to shut up and keep humping.

WE’RE ALL PROS ALREADY
All of us are pros in one area: our jobs.
We get a paycheck. We work for money. We are professionals.
Now: Are there principles we can take from what we’re 
already successfully doing in our workaday lives and apply to 
our artistic aspirations? What exactly are the qualities that 
define us as professionals?
1) We show up every day. We might do it only because 
we have to, to keep from getting fired. But we do it. 
We show up every day.
2) We show up no matter what. In sickness and in 
health, come hell or high water, we stagger in to the 
factory. We might do it only so as not to let down our 
co-workers, or for other, less noble reasons. But we do 
it. We show up no matter what.
3) We stay on the job all day. Our minds may wander, 
but our bodies remain at the wheel. We pick up the 
phone when it rings, we assist the customer when he 
seeks our help. We don’t go home till the whistle 
blows.
4) We are committed over the long haul. Next year we 
may go to another job, another company, another 
country. But we’ll still be working. Until we hit the 
lottery, we are part of the labor force.
5) The stakes for us are high and real. This is about 
survival, feeding our families, educating our children. 
It’s about eating.
6) We accept remuneration for our labor. We’re not here 
for fun. We work for money.
7) We do not overidentify with our jobs. We may take 
pride in our work, we may stay late and come in on 
weekends, but we recognize that we are not our job 
descriptions. The amateur, on the other hand, 
overidentifies with his avocation, his artistic 
aspiration. He defines himself by it. He is a musician, 
a painter, a playwright. Resistance loves this. 
Resistance knows that the amateur composer will 
never write his symphony because he is overly 
invested in its success and overterrified of its failure. 
The amateur takes it so seriously it paralyzes him.
8) We master the technique of our jobs.
9) We have a sense of humor about our jobs.
10) We receive praise or blame in the real world

I spent so much of my life terrified of what I was going to become and whether I was going to be right here right now. 
God, how much time did I waste afraid I wasn’t going to be right here right now?
If I could change, the only thing I’d change about my whole life would be fearing less that I wouldn’t get right here - the place I was going anyway.
I wouldn’t change all the mistakes and mishaps, I needed those.
But all the constantly worry that I wasn’t going to make it, that took me out of enjoying the moment.
It took me out of enjoying these experiences, smiling or eating my lunch or doing whatever I was doing.
Know your mission, have faith you’re going to get there.
Wherever you go, it’s going to be alright.
Just find ways to get out of your head.

Above all, do not lose your desire to walk: every day I walk myself into a state of well-being and walk away from every illness; I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it. Even if one were to walk for one's health and it were constantly one station ahead—I would still say: Walk! Besides, it is also apparent that in walking one constantly gets as close to well-being as possible, even if one does not quite reach it—but by sitting still, and the more one sits still, the closer one comes to feeling ill. Health and salvation can be found only in motion. If anyone denies that motion exists, I do as Diogenes did, I walk. If anyone denies that health resides in motion, then I walk away from all morbid objections. Thus, if one just keeps on walking, everything will be all right.

To those human beings who are of any concern to me I wish suffering, desolation, sickness, ill-treatment, indignities—I wish that they should not remain unfamiliar with profound self-contempt, the torture of self-mistrust, the wretchedness of the vanquished: I have no pity for them, because I wish them the only thing that can prove today whether one is worth anything or not—that one endures.

In judo, so many people care about rank and what degree black belt they are. I have never gotten caught up in that. Rank is based solely on a board of people getting together and saying, "Oh, you deserve to be such-and-such a rank." Once you give them the power to tell you you're great, you've also given them the power to tell you you're unworthy. Once you start caring about people's opinions of you, you give up control.It's the same reason I don't get caught up in being the crowd tavorite when I fight. It's why I don't read things that are written about me. One of the greatest days of my life was when I came to understand that other people's approval and my happiness were not related.

Perhaps a better way to internalize boredom is to accept it, and to see it as something you have a relationship with. Trying to run away from it results in a desire for excitement, which paradoxically leads to more boredom because your threshold for excitement keeps increasing. Instead, if we acknowledge that even the best lives are punctuated with boredom, then we will understand how this slowdown in attention can be interpreted as a welcomed state of mind.

The greatest weight. What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: "This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live it once more and innumerable times more: and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence — even this spider and this moonlight between the trees, and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, speck of dust!" Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: "You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine." If this thought gained possession of you, it would change you as your are or perhaps crush you. The question in each and every thing, "Do you desire this once more and innumerable times more?" would lie upon your actions as the greatest weight. Or how well disposed would you have to become to yourself and to life to crave nothing more reverently than this ultimate eternal confirmation and seal?

It's a healthy practice to approach our work with as few accepted rules, starting points, and limitations as possible. Often the standards in our chosen medium are so ubiquitous, we take them for granted. They are invisible and unquestioned.
This makes it nearly impossible to think outside the standard paradigm.

To get status, you have to give up status. You have to sacrifice some existing status to make it back and more. This is especially true in creative fields and high-upside opportunities. Writers, musicians, actors, directors, entrepreneurs must all do their time in status limbo. And you don’t know how long that time will be. How well you tolerate this state can be the “winning” difference between you and someone just as talented and hard-working as you.

At critical moments in time, you can raise the aspirations of other people significantly, especially when they are relatively young, simply by suggesting they do something better or more ambitious than what they might have in mind.  It costs you relatively little to do this, but the benefit to them, and to the broader world, may be enormous.

This is in fact one of the most valuable things you can do with your time and with your life.
