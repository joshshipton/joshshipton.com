#### [Sapient Algorithms](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tahymCqG9jCJtiy4F/sapient-algorithms?fbclid=IwAR3C8nHfVOJs8AEPvhDKvS902M-fDNW5tZwFsM_fx1VKajSNOn8MqvVs-ms)

Quite an overly analytical way of thinking about conciousness and everyday actions. I enjoyed the autism in this one. 

#### [History of Wrestling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_wrestling_

Been reading a lot of Wikipedia articles lately and getting stuck in a lot of Wikipedia rabbit holes. But this one I particularly enjoyed. The more I read and think about it the more I realise that wrestling is <u>THE</u> sport for humans.  Virtually all of the early sports were some kind of wrestling, it's in our epics, in our religions, everywhere. I love it. If you enjoyed this you might also enjoy [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling)

#### [The Lindy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect)

Cool phenomenon in which something that has been around for a long time is more likely to be around in the future. Reminds me of [The mediocrity Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediocrity_principle), My small but very intellectually curious brain loves simple answers to very complex problems.

### [HPMOR](https://www.lesswrong.com/hpmor)

I've studied philosophy since I was 13. I have an undergraduate degree in philosophy. I think that this book has had a bigger impact on my personal philosophy that anything else I have ever read. Cannot recommend enough
