----------

hello again,
being done with exams has given me the time to revamp some stuff on joshshipton.com. as well as this me and my good friend claude have build some nifty internal tools (can be found <a href="https://github.com/joshshipton/joshshipton.com">here</a>) that will make it super seamless to save and push content to this website.
my plan for this section is to save my favourite pieces of content every week, then i can share this content-complete link to all my friends, instead of spamming them with random bits and links throughout the week.
hopefully there's something you find interesting here, <3 josh

## Articles & Essays
#### [reasons to believe (that p=np)](https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=122)
great musings on p=np, interesting and brief i especially enjoyed.
<div class="quote">
The Philosophical Argument. If P=NP, then the world would be a profoundly different place than we usually assume it to be. There would be no special value in "creative leaps," no fundamental gap between solving a problem and recognizing the solution once it's found. Everyone who could appreciate a symphony would be Mozart; everyone who could follow a step-by-step argument would be Gauss; everyone who could recognize a good investment strategy would be Warren Buffett. It's possible to put the point in Darwinian terms: if this is the sort of universe we inhabited, why wouldn't we already have evolved to take advantage of it? (Indeed, this is an argument not only for P!=NP, but for NP-complete problems not being efficiently solvable in the physical world.)
The Utilitarian Argument. Suppose you believe P!=NP. Then there are only two possibilities, both of which are deeply gratifying: either you're right, or else there's a way to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. (I realize that I've given a general argument for pessimism.)
