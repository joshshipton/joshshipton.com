1. Finish Python Script to turn the template into html
    add support for images as well

2. Update JSON object and make JSON object a seperate file with data from .txt file

3. actually write blog posts.....

4. make some kind of backend api that emails can be sent to and then commited to the db. Right now this doesn't work at all....











xx. Make a local database.db to store the blog posts? can just have an sqllite command in a bash file that does it automatically, this can come later thoughts
