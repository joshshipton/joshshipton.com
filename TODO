1. Finish Python Script to turn the template into html
    add support for images as well

2. Update JSON object and make JSON object a seperate file with data from .txt file

3. actually write blog posts.....

4. a way to actually send emails, an ON UPDATE to blog posts would work. Another thing that would work is a script that just loops thru the emails in the db












xx. Make a local database.db to store the blog posts? can just have an sqllite command in a bash file that does it automatically, this can come later thoughts
