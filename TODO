1. Finish Python Script to turn the template into html
    add support for images as well

2. Update JSON object and make JSON object a seperate file with data from .txt file

3. actually write blog posts.....

4. a way to actually send emails, an ON UPDATE to blog posts would work. Another thing that would work is a script that just loops thru the emails in the db

5. write code that when they sign up first tries to send an email to them before commiting the email to the db

6. add a "i have no attention span buttom" that people can press to toggle images 




xx. Make a local database.db to store the blog posts? can just have an sqllite command in a bash file that does it automatically, this can come later thoughts
