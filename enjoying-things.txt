If you don’t like something. maybe you just haven’t done it enough
25/10/2023

Life hack I’ve realized lately. Pretty much anything will become enjoyable if you do it long enough. I realized this with maths. In high school I hated maths and actually ended up failing my final exams,  but since getting to university and studying higher level mathematics I’ve come to see how it's enjoyable. It’s actually become one of my favorite subjects and I regularly find myself reading and learning about maths outside of my degree.   

This makes sense if you think about it logically. If there’s a substantial subset of the population that enjoy doing x then there’s probably some way of; doing x, thinking about x or approaching x that makes x  enjoyable. So if you do x long enough you’re probably going to find the subset of x or approach to x that makes x enjoyable for you. Just food for thought. Before you decide that you don’t like something for whatever reason, think about it if you're given enough time and energy to the activity.

And for the love of god DO NOT use the “but I’m not good at x” excuse. Having an innate predisposition to being good at certain things does not exist and if you think it does go read https://www.amazon.com.au/Talent-Code-Greatness-Grown-Heres/dp/055380684X or https://www.amazon.com.au/Mindset-Updated-Carol-Dweck/dp/147213995X. Or read my blog post here (haven't actually written it yet….). And then if you somehow still believe that innate talent and predisposed ability exists, gaslight yourself into thinking that it doesn’t. Your life will immediately become more enjoyable without this self-imposed limiting factor.
