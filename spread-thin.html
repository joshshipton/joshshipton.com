        <title>The case for spreading yourself thin

            You should be doing more, especially if you’re average.

        <p>
            I didn’t feel like writing a blog post today but <a
                href="https://ch3ngl0rd.bearblog.dev/">my friend Zac</a> told
            me
            “Josh you haven't written a blog post in a while you should write
            one”
            So here it is. Now a little bit about me to give context for this
            rant.
            I’m a pretty average individual. I’ve never been really amazing at
            anything but I’ve worked hard to become almost-decent in a few
            domains
            and something I’ve figured out is that the best way to stand-out
            when
            you’re average is to spread yourself thin. You should be dedicating
            your
            time to at least two pursuits even if totally unrelated.
        </p>
        <h4>
            The reason for this.
        </h4>
        <p>
            It’s really hard to stand out in a single domain. Being the best at
            anything is extremely difficult and in today's world of instant,
            wide-reaching
            comparison you’re always going to be compared to the best.
            But if you spread yourself thin, it becomes vastly easier to

                <p>
                    No I’ve not gone crazy, this means something. I got it from
                    <a href="https://chriswillx.com/podcast/">Chris
                        Williams</a>
                    and what it means
                    is
                    that
                    individually both of these things are pretty standard. You
                    see a
                    bear.
                    That's standard. You see a bicycle and even more so. But a
                    bear
                    ON a
                    bicycle. Now that's something special. You can use this
                    principle in
                    your own life to stand out, a CEO who writes amazing poetry.
                    Wow. An
                    athlete who’s also a brilliant writer. Wow. A successful
                    lawyer
                    who can
                    also play high level league of legends... wow?? (ok maybe
                    not
                    that
                    last
                    one).

                <p>
                    I know people like to say that their self-worth isn't tied
                    to
                    anything
                    but rather an unchanging property
                    that’s
                    immune
                    to any outside influences. But at the end of the day a <a
                        href="https://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person?utm_source=clouds-and-dirt.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=lindy-library-the-0-1-of-ideas-i-ve-found">harsh
                        truth</a>
                    is that other people will judge you not only on your
                    character
                    but also
                    on your capacity as a human. If you think they don’t look at
                    how
                    people
                    treat a CEO of a successful company compared to a homeless
                    man.
                    Splitting yourself across two domains lets you lean on one
                    when
                    the
                    other isn’t going great. Injured from your sport, go code.
                    Can’t
                    act
                    much at the moment because there are no productions? Go
                    write
                    another
                    novel. It decreases the chance that you can’t perform and
                    bring
                    some
                    kind of value to the world or to yourself, reducing the
                    chance
                    of your
                    sense of worth being affected.

                <h4>

                    How I apply this to my own life.
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Personally I split most of my time between the Olympic sport
                    of
                    Judo and
                    programming with a ton of small interests scattered into the
                    mix
                    (chess,
                    studying german, reading, writing, etc, etc). I'm pretty
                    average
                    at both
                    (if you don’t know what Judo is watch <a
                        href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al9GNRQAH3I&ab_channel=GrapplerKingdom">this</a>
                    ).
                    But if you compare me to other programmers I’m probably an
                    above
                    average
                    athlete. And if you compare me to other athletes I'm
                    probably an
                    above
                    average programmer. More than that I also personally enjoy
                    being
                    multifaceted. It means that I’m around a more diverse range
                    of
                    people
                    and get to switch between doing vastly different things on a
                    daily
                    basis.

                    Other than that I feel like being a well rounded human is
                    just a
                    nice
                    thing to do. You should read
                    <a href=(https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/41795733">Range</a>
                    if you
                    like this
                    idea but want actual logical reasons for being a
                    multi-dimensional human
                    being. It's a really good read where the author gives a
                    scientific
                    account against early specialization and advocates for a
                    broad
                    range of
                    experience.
