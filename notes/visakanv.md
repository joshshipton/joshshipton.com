this dude might be one of the best self help smart people ive ever found so based

"Attention might be the core ‘currency’. Possibly the most important thing in a friendship – including one with yourself, or your spouse, or your child – is attention. Deep, focused, undivided, non-judgemental attention. To really see + hear the other person, in a world where people constantly feel unseen & unheard. (Being attentive is how you notice things in people that they may not have noticed in themselves, and this can be an incredibly powerful way to connect with someone.)

So: the most important thing about the most important thing in life is attention, and in schools, in my opinion, we often screw up how we teach it. If you use threats and coercion to force kids to “pay” attention… …you set people up for dysfunctional relationships their whole life! (“PAY ATTENTION TO ME!”)"


"Optimize for referrals – rather than try to meet 100 new people blind, meet the 100 or so people you already know, identify the best 5-10 of them (whatever that means to you), and then develop yourself so those people refer you to their friends"

that is huge, so smart, who are the best people i know, jason, jack, declan, jes etc. etc. why make friends with 100 more people when you can make friends with their best friends, so smart. 


"The more interesting question to ask, compared to “how do you compete with smarter people”, is “how do you win the love, trust, support & goodwill of smarter people, so that THEY are on YOUR side?” It’s interesting how rarely anybody seems to ask this. I think about this all the time."

SO REAL.

 The importance of house parties and scene managers 

 Host parties, and introduce the coolest of your friends to each other.

 When you go looking for them you’ll find several examples of house parties or home gatherings of some kind. The first that come to mind for me are:

 Aspasia, lover of Pericles, hosted house parties that Socrates would attend.

 William Wordsworth hosted hundreds of visitors and popularized the Lake District (sort of like the mayor of Miami but appealing to poets and artists). He went on to become Poet Laureate of the UK. Wordsworth is even more important and significant than I realized – his poetry was a beacon of hope and joy amidst much despairing utilitarianism.

 Max Planck and his wife, hosted parties attended by Einstein and friends. "The Planck home became a social and cultural center. Numerous well-known scientists – Einstein, Hahn, Meitner were frequent visitors". They'd play music together. And advance the frontiers of science for all of humanity.

 Gertrude Stein, hosted parties in Paris attended by Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclar Lewis, Ezra Pound, Sherwood Anderson and Henri Matisse. The gatherings in the Stein home "brought together confluences of talent and thinking that would help define modernism in literature and art".  (Thread)

 Andy Warhol’s Factory: Andy Warhol arguably bootstrapped a scene "by himself" – I mean, lots of people showed up at his Factory, but it was *his* Factory. Somebody needs to play host to all the weirdos. The Factory was Andy Warhol's NYC studio, which had three locations between 1962 and 1984. It "became a well-known gathering place that brought together distinguished intellectuals, drag queens, playwrights, Bohemian street people, Hollywood celebrities, and wealthy patrons."

"Self-love isn’t just bubble baths and spa days, it’s about confronting the “monster” within yourself that you have ostracized for being shameful, cringe, dangerous, gross, grotesque – and embracing that part of yourself. (Notice how common it is for people to feel that they “have” to ostracize a part of themselves in order to avoid being ostracized by others in turn.)"

i love this, love, love, love. 

in order to not be ostracised by others you ostracise yourrself from yourself, is that not worse? great frame.
