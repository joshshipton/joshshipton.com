Aldous Huxley, the author of Brave New World, had a theory of the brain he called the Reduction Valve. The theory went that the brain learned internal boring mechanisms to desensitize us to the world's innate interestingness. Animals that focused on food and sex rather than appreciating the world around them survived, and ones that evolved mechanisms to inhibit their senses from ever experiencing the true information around us did even better.

Huxley invented this theory after a positive experience with mescaline, a psychoactive chemical akin to LSD or psilocybin producing mushrooms. These chemicals often give their consumers a feeling that the word is more enchanted than they realized before the experience. While it might feel subjectively like there's an increase the brain's activity, psychedelics actually decrease blood flow throughout the brain. Hence, the reduction valve theory.

More recently, physicist Donald Hoffman proposed a similar idea called The Interface Theory of Perception after studying reinforcement learning agents and seeing that their learned focused entirely on information needed to reproduce, rather than accurately representing the environment around them.

One beautiful date I discovered is going to a new forest together, smell everything, and compress your favorite smelling findings into candles over the course of an evening. If they’re adventurous, keep the end-goal a secret until you’re back home and start molding the candles. It ends up being 10 hours of talking, exploring, and crafting.

Another meaningful experience is to tell each other your life stories. Surprisingly, most people have not gotten a chance to hear their own life story. Leave three hours per person to go in depth and you’ll each discover trends and threads from your life that become obvious at such a macro view.

these are both amazing
