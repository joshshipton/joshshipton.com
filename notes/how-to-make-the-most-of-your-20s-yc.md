they try and hack the hedonic treadmil by telling people to go through it slowly, e.g your first house should not be much better than your dorm room, not sure how much i agree with this tbh, living below your means good, but i dont think that you need to slow down your life in order to be happier, if you do then you have a very matieralistic outview on life and thats kinda another problem in of itself 

go hardcore early is really good advice i think

its far easier to mellow out than it is to go hardcore, should start doing the hardest craziest things and then mellow down, the other way round is probbaly impossible. i will do this by trying to grapple + code and trying to get a hft job.
