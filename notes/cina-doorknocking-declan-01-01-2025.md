objection list :


- how did you get my number
    - public data base, only calling people who we believe would benefit from the information. won't call again but please let us know if you change your mind.

- not going anywhere for some time
   - i completley understand {name} its great that youre happy where you are. actually many of our past clients werent planning to move when we first connected, but theyr eally appreaicated staying informed about their neighborhood's propertyy values. are you sure you wouldnt be intrested in knowing the final sale price when this propety sells? its helpful information to have, even if youre planning to stay put for now.

- why are you calling me i dont care?

    - i completley understad, most home owners i speak with appreciate knowing what similar properties in the same area are selling for, it directly impacts their own properties value. are you sure you don't want to be informed about the final sale price for the propety on hampton street.


for when they call back:
hi there, this is josh from C realty, thank you for returning my call-> i just wanted to call to let you know about a new listing on hampton street.




notes (stream):

"i thought this was a recording" - sound less automated?

"i dont care" -> agree more, i understand you dont care, i get you probably have a lot on your mind right now, if you change your mind please dont hesitate to contact us

people cutting you off -> just cop it? how to make hook more engaging?

hang up straight away -> i need a better hook.

this is fucking hard -> just cop it, stocisicm training, it doesnt matter, iterate, iterate, iterate

sales takes a lot of dog

i think people are more willing to talk to people in person or at least be nicer to you. over the phone its easier to just be rude to someone.

ok the hook just sucks, its too vauge, "property on hampton street" just doesnt work. even when people connect it just doesnt work.






### list of people to email:

lisascappatura@hotmail.com - wants to be emailed about sale price, also coming to home open, doesnt want to buy. not intrested in selling.
