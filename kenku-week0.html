            id='title'>What I've learnt the first week of programming my
            "startup"</h1><p>I wanted to write a post about what I've been doing
            in my first week of university break.</p>
            <p><a href="https://kenku.org/">Kenku</a> (Currently Beta testers
            only) is an application that I'm busy developing that hopes to help
            combat sports athletes better manage their training sessions and
            streamline their learning and skill acquisition. I see it as a
            mobile app in the future but for now I'm building it on the web with
            the SuKit stack (hosted on Vercel) to minimize developer rage and
            maximize iteration speed. I really believe that iteration speed is
            everything when building a project, you need to be able to pivot or
            abandon features whilst losing as little time as possible.</p>
            
            <h4>Key Takeaways From the first week</h4>

                <li>Nothing feels
                    better than making something, solving problems and being
                    engrossed in a problem for hours on end</li>
                </p>

                    If
                    you think AI is going to replace you, you have a skill
                    issue. Chat-GPT is a child with instant access to the
                    internet who can also talk really fast. It knows a lot but
                    it makes stupid mistakes and often gives sub-optimal
                    solutions to simple problems. I've found using it for
                    anything more than boiler-plate to be more time-consuming
                    than just writing the code by myself. </li>

                            This is hard, like really hard. Going to have to
                            invest a good amount of time into learning how to
                            make an intuitive, user friendly frontend.</p><p></li></p><p><li></p><p>Treading
                            the line between complexity and simplicity. Great
                            software has value in its ability to do complex
                            things, doing complex things simply is the goal but
                            doing complex things simply is hard. It's usually
                            far easier and faster to do complex things in a
                            complex way. Not sure what the solution is here,
                            probably just a skill issue to be honest. </li></p>

                                Direction. It's hard to figure out what features I want to invest the most time into fleshing out. Or what I should be working on at any given moment. Probably need to take some time to really plan out the entirety of the application instead of just having a rough idea in my head.
