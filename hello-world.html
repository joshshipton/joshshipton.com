    <h1 id="title">Hello World!</h1>
    <p>I've finally decided to go ahead and start a blog. "Blog" is probably pushing it, to be honest. You can think of this as a collective home for all of my ramblings that won't get me canceled.</p>
    <p>I've been blog-curious ever since I found <a href="https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/">Alex Guzey</a>, but what finally pushed me over the edge was Ben Kuhn's, <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/writing/">Why and how to write things on the Internet.</a>
        <aside>(Both amazing writers. You should check them both out.)</aside>
        <p>The main points that inspired me were making new, interesting friends that you otherwise would never have access to and creating new and interesting conversations with already existing friends. Getting better at writing was a big plus too.</p>
        <p>Another feature of this blog is that it will only use vanilla CSS/HTML/JS (I can't wait to see the abomination I create). The blog will be simple, but I'm excited to see what kind of features I can add all on my lonesome.</p>
        <h4>Disclaimer!</h4>
        <p>What lies ahead will be a slew of very average writing from a very averagely intelligent person. Please proceed at your own risk.</p>
