    <h1 id="title">Relaxing Vs Rejuvenating activities</h1>
    <p>(DRAFT)</p>
    <p>
      There’s this big mix up that people have between doing things that are
      relaxing and doing things that are rejuvenating. I’m quickly gonna define
      both for you and explain when you should opt for one over the other and
      why.
    </p>
    <p>Let the domain of discourse here be all activities</p>
    <p>
      Relaxing - things that are fun, things that relax you and get you ready to
      do nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rejuvenating - things that give you energy, things that make you want to
      work
    </p>
    <p>
      E.G an ice bath or cold shower isn’t relaxing, but it's rejuvenating after
      doing it you’ll be ready to do more work afterwards. Light aerobic
      exercise is rejuvenating but not relaxing. Watching a movie is relaxing
      but not rejuvenating, you won’t want to do more work afterwards even
      though it's a restful activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insight that I want to expand on. Restful is usually more enjoyable as it
      gives you more dopamine than the work activity, not always the case with
      rejuvenating though.
